## Overview

Routing is the term used to describe how a URL gets mapped to actions and input variables in your application. In Preside, the action will be a [Coldbox event handler](https://coldbox.ortusbooks.com/the-basics/event-handlers) and the input variables will appear in your request context.

We use Coldbox's own routing system along with a Preside addition for handling dynamic routes. When creating your own custom routes, you are free to use either system.

URLs can be built with `event.buildLink()`. Different routing URLs will be generated depending on the arguments passed to the `buildLink()` function.

## Creating custom routes

To create custom routes for your site, you must create a `Routes.cfm` file in your `/application/config/` directory. In this file, you can create regular [ColdBox routes](https://coldbox.ortusbooks.com/the-basics/routing) as well as Preside routes. The following `routes.cfm` file registers a couple of Preside route handlers:

```luceescript
addRouteHandler( getModel( "myCustomRouteHandler" ) );
addRouteHandler( CreateObject( "app.routeHandlers.anotherCustomRouteHandler" ).init() );
```

### Preside Route Handlers

A Preside Route Handler is any CFC that implements a simple interface to handle routing. The interface looks like this:

```luceescript
interface {
    // match(): return true if the incoming URL path should be handled by this route handler
    public boolean function match( required string path, required any event ) {}

    // translate(): take an incoming URL and translate it - use the ColdBox event object to set variables and the current event
    public void    function translate( required string path, required any event ) {}

    // reverseMatch(): return true if the incomeing set of arguments passed to buildLink() should be handled by this route handler
    public boolean function reverseMatch( required struct buildArgs ) {}

    // build(): take incoming buildLink() arguments and return a URL string
    public string  function build( required struct buildArgs ) {}
}
```

An example route handler, that deals with custom URLs for a "My Profile" area of a website, might look like this:

```luceescript
component implements="preside.system.routeHandlers.iRouteHandler" {

    public boolean function match( required string path, required any event ) {
        return ReFindNoCase( "^/my-profile/", arguments.path );
    }

    public void function translate( required string path, required any event ) {
        var coldboxEventName = ReReplace( arguments.path, "^/my-profile/", "myprofilemodule:myprofile/" );

        coldboxEventName = ListChangeDelims( coldboxEventName, ".", "/" );

        if ( ListLen( coldboxEventName, "." ) lt 2 ) {
            coldboxEventName = coldboxEventName & "." & "index";
        }

        event.setValue( "event", coldboxEventName );
    }

    public boolean function reverseMatch( required struct buildArgs ) {
        return Len( Trim( buildArgs.linkTo ?: "" ) ) and ListFirst( buildArgs.linkTo, "." ) eq "myprofilemodule:myprofile";
    }

    public string function build( required struct buildArgs ) {
        var link = "/my-profile/#ListChangeDelims( ListRest( buildArgs.linkTo, "." ), "/", "." )#/";

        if ( Len( Trim( buildArgs.queryString ?: "" ) ) ) {
            link &= "?" & buildArgs.queryString;
        }

        return link;
    }
}
```

## URL Rewriting

In order for the core routes to work, URL rewrites need to be in place. Preside server distributions ship with the [Tuckey URL rewrite filter](http://tuckey.org/urlrewrite/) installed and expect to find a `urlrewrite.xml` file in your webroot. The Preside site skeleton builder creates one of these for you with the following rules which you are then free to modify and/or augment:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE urlrewrite PUBLIC "-//tuckey.org//DTD UrlRewrite 4.0//EN" "http://www.tuckey.org/res/dtds/urlrewrite4.0.dtd">
<urlrewrite>
    <rule>
        <note>
            All request to system static assets that live under /preside/system/assets
            should go through Railo and will be rewritten to /index.cfm
        </note>
        <from>^/preside/system/assets/.*$</from>
        <to>%{context-path}/index.cfm</to>
    </rule>

    <rule>
        <note>
            All request to *.html or ending in / will be rewritten to /index.cfm
        </note>
        <from>^(/((.*?)(\.html|/))?)$</from>
        <to>%{context-path}/index.cfm</to>
    </rule>

    <rule>
        <note>
            Disable Lucee Context except for local requests
        </note>
        <condition type="remote-addr" operator="notequal">^(127\.0\.0\.1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1)$</condition>
        <from>^/lucee/.*$</from>
        <set type="status">404</set>
        <to>null</to>
    </rule>

     <rule>
        <note>
            All the following requests should not be allowed and should return with a 404
            We block any request to:

            * the application folder (where all the logic and views for your site lives)
            * the uploads folder (should be configured to be somewhere else anyways)
            * this url rewrite file!
        </note>
        <from>^/(application/|uploads/|urlrewrite\.xml\b)</from>
        <set type="status">404</set>
        <to>null</to>
    </rule>
</urlrewrite>
```

## Out-of-the-box routes

### Site tree pages

Any URL that ends with `.html` followed by an optional query string, will be routed as a site tree page URL. The "directories" and "filename" will correspond to the slugs of the pages in your tree. For example:

```
/about-us/meet-the-team/alex-skinner.html?showComments=true
```

will be routed to:

```luceescript
Coldbox event : core.SiteTreePageRequestHandler
Coldbox RC    : { showComments : true }
Coldbox PRC   : { slug : "about-us.meet-the-team.alex-skinner" }
```

and map to the site tree page:

```
/about-us
    /meet-the-team
        alex-skinner
```

>>>>>> You can build a link to a site tree page with `event.buildLink( page=idOfThePage )`

### Preside Admin pages and actions

Any URL that begins with `/(adminPath)` and ends in a forward slash followed by an optional query string, will be routed as a Preside admin request. Directory nodes in the URL will be translated to the ColdBox event.

>>> Your admin path can be configured in your site's `Config.cfc` file with the `settings.preside_admin_path` setting. The setting defaults to "preside_admin".

For example, assuming that `settings.preside_admin_path` has been set to "acme_cmsarea", the URL `/acme_cmsarea/sitetree/editPage/?id=F4554E4C-9347-4F7E-B5F862595BFC9EBF` will be routed to:

```luceescript
Coldbox event : admin.sitetree.editPage
Coldbox RC    : { id : "F4554E4C-9347-4F7E-B5F862595BFC9EBF" }
```

>>>>>> You can build a link to an admin event with `event.buildAdminLink( linkTo="sitetree.editPage", queryString="id=#pageId#" )` or `event.buildLink( linkTo="admin.sitetree.editPage", queryString="id=#pageId#" )`

### Asset manager assets

Assets stored in the asset manager are served through the application. Any URL that starts with `/asset` and ends with a trailing slash will be routed to the asset manager download action. URLs take the form: `/asset/(asset ID)/` or `/asset/(asset ID)/(ID or name of derivative)/`. So the URL, `/asset/F4554E4C-9347-4F7E-B5F862595BFC9EBF/`, is routed to:

```luceescript
Coldbox event : core.assetDownload
Coldbox RC    : { assetId : "F4554E4C-9347-4F7E-B5F862595BFC9EBF" }
```

and `/asset/F4554E4C-9347-4F7E-B5F862595BFC9EBF/headerImage/` becomes:

```luceescript
Coldbox event : core.assetDownload
Coldbox RC    : { assetId : "F4554E4C-9347-4F7E-B5F862595BFC9EBF", derivativeId : "headerImage" }
```

>>>>>> You can build a link to an asset with `event.buildAdminLink( assetId=myAssetId )` or `event.buildLink( assetId=myAssetId, derivative=derivativeId )`
