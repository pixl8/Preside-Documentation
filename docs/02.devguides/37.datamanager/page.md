## Introduction

Preside's Data Manager is a sophisticated auto CRUD admin for your data objects. With very little configuration, you are able to set up listing screens, add, edit and delete screens, version history screens, auditing, translation, bulk edit functionality, etc. In addition, as of Preside 10.9.0, this system can be highly customized both globally and _per data object_ so that you can rapidly build awesome custom admin interfaces in front of your application's database.
