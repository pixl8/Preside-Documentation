title: Upgrade/Release notes
---

The Preside team use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for their release versions. Our version numbers look like this: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Where:

* **MAJOR** means a version when we make incompatible API changes
* **MINOR** means a version when we add functionality in a backward compatible manner
* **PATCH** means a version when we make backward compatible bug fixes

It is worth noting, that we have NEVER made a MAJOR release. Backward compatibility is very important to us. If and when we DO create a new release, it will be for really good reasons and we'll STILL be considering compatibility with the utmost effort.

We release **minor** versions with relative frequency, currently around 8 releases a year. You will find upgrade notes between minor versions in this chapter.

We release **patch** versions very frequently - once we have validated bugfixes, we don't tend to hang around to release them. Release notes for every minor and patch release can be found on the Preside website: [https://www.preside.org/developers/release-notes.html](https://www.preside.org/developers/release-notes.html)

Note: If you are updating over multiple major versions, e.g. from `10.6.x` to `10.8.x`, you should read the upgrade notes for each release in between.
